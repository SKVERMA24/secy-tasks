          <h1>AUTONOMOUS NAVIGATION</h1>
          <br />This project focuses on developing a fully autonomous mobile
          robot using the TortoiseBot platform. The objective is to enable the
          robot to explore an unknown environment, create a real-time map using
          SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), and navigate efficiently
          to user-defined goals using path planning algorithms within the ROS
          (Robot Operating System) framework

          <h1>Ball Balancing Bot</h1>
          <br />In this project, you will build a robotic system that can
          balance a ball on a flat platform using two servo motors and a
          Raspberry Pi. A camera mounted above the platform will track the
          ball’s position in real time using computer vision, and a PID control
          algorithm will adjust the platform angle to keep the ball centered.
          You’ll learn to combine hardware, software, vision, and control in one
          exciting hands-on build. By the end of the project, you’ll have a
          fully working bot that reacts intelligently—just like a real balancing
          system

          <h1>HEXAPOD</h1>
          <br />This project focuses on designing and testing the control and
          locomotion system of a hexapod robot. The robot utilizes an RC-based
          communication system to execute smooth walking and obstacle-climbing
          maneuvers. Various gait patterns are implemented for efficient
          movement and enhanced stability on uneven terrain. The ultimate goal
          is to develop a terrain-adaptive hexapod suitable for real-world
          applications and research in robotics and mobility.

          <h1>Mechanical Turk</h1>
          <br />The Mechanical Turk was historically a machine that appeared to
          play chess autonomously, but in reality, it had a chess master hidden
          underneath, secretly controlling its movements. We, of course, won’t
          be hiding a chess master under a table—mainly because we don’t have
          one. Instead, as engineers, it’s much more feasible (and fun) for us
          to build a robot that actually plays chess. So if you ever feel that
          playing chess over the board is far more satisfying than playing
          online, come pay the Turk a visit!

          <h1>StepXplorer</h1>
          <br />Autonomous & Adaptive: In this project, we will build a stair
          climbing bot. It can detect and climb stairs on its own using
          ultrasonic sensors Balanced for Purpose: The robot will also have a
          strong and stable platform to carry things while moving. It will stay
          balanced even when going over rough or uneven surfaces
